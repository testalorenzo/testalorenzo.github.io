In contemporary science, I find statistics to be an essential tool to understand phenomena, and to draw reliable conclusions. My research focuses on developing new theory and methods that integrate state-of-the-art ML prediction algorithms into stable inferential frameworks, mainly through the lens of semiparametric statistics. I am also broadly interested in the analysis of large and complex data, with particular emphasis on structured objects such as functional data and networks. My work is often inspired by problems in causal inference or interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers in the sciences.

## Some projects

These are some of the projects I have (somehow recently) been working on:

- Semiparametric semi-supervised learning for general targets under distribution shift and decaying overlap, a joint work with [Qi Xu](https://statsqixu.github.io/), [Jing Lei](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~jinglei/), and [Kathryn Roeder](https://kathrynmroeder.github.io/). The preprint is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06452).

- Doubly robust estimation of functional average treatment effects, together with [Tobia Boschi](https://research.ibm.com/people/tobia-boschi), [Francesca Chiaromonte](https://sites.psu.edu/chiaromonte/), [Edward H. Kennedy](https://www.ehkennedy.com/), and [Matthew Reimherr](http://www.personal.psu.edu/mlr36/). The preprint is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06024).

- Functional Feature Selection, jointly with [Tobia Boschi](https://research.ibm.com/people/tobia-boschi), [Francesca Chiaromonte](https://sites.psu.edu/chiaromonte/), and [Matthew Reimherr](http://www.personal.psu.edu/mlr36/). [This](https://testalorenzo.github.io/files/FAStEN_poster.pdf) is a poster on `FAStEN`, an efficient algorithm for feature selection and coefficient estimation in functional regression models. The paper on `FAStEN` has been published on JCGS in November 2024, and the preprint is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14801)

- [The Weighted Climate Dataset](https://weightedclimatedata.streamlit.app/ 'climate'), together with [Marco Gortan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-gortan/), [Giorgio Fagiolo](https://sites.google.com/view/giorgiofagiolo/home), and [Francesco Lamperti](http://www.francescolamperti.eu/). The papers introducing this tool are available [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03304-1) and [here](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2024/34)

- COVID-19, a joint work with [Tobia Boschi](https://research.ibm.com/people/tobia-boschi), [Jacopo Di Iorio](https://science.psu.edu/stat/people/jqd5830), [Francesca Chiaromonte](https://sites.psu.edu/chiaromonte/), and [Marzia A. Cremona](https://marziacremona.com/). Results of our first paper appeared in the news [[1]](https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/staying-home-primary-care-and-limiting-contagion-hubs-may-curb-covid-19-deaths/), [[2, Italian]](https://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/covid-italia-statistica-che-analizza-prima-ondata-perche-tassi-mortalita-tanto-diversi-le-regioni-AEfHQmf), [[3, Italian]](https://www.santannapisa.it/it/news/covid-19-italia-la-statistica-fa-luce-sul-perche-la-prima-ondata-abbia-causato-tassi-di), and as a [SciPod's audio book](https://www.scipod.global/dr-marzia-cremona-using-functional-data-analysis-to-better-understand-covid-19-mortality/). A second paper is available as a preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09820)!

You can find my publication record in my [CV](/files/CV_updated_Jan25.pdf) and on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gDmLTJQAAAAJ&hl "Google_Scholar") profile.
