In contemporary science, I find statistics to be an essential tool to understand phenomena, and to draw reliable conclusions. I am broadly interested in the analysis of large and complex data, with particular emphasis on structured objects such as functional data and networks. I am also keen on the development of new theory and methods to integrate state-of-the-art ML prediction algorithms into stable inferential frameworks. My work is often inspired by problems in causal inference or interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers in the sciences.

## Some projects

These are some of the projects I have (somehow recently) been working on:

- Functional Feature Selection, jointly with [Tobia Boschi](https://research.ibm.com/people/tobia-boschi), [Francesca Chiaromonte](https://sites.psu.edu/chiaromonte/), and [Matthew Reimherr](http://www.personal.psu.edu/mlr36/). [This](https://testalorenzo.github.io/files/FAStEN_poster.pdf) is a poster on `FAStEN`, an efficient algorithm for feature selection and coefficient estimation in functional regression models. The paper on `FAStEN` has been published on JCGS in November 2024, and the preprint is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14801)

- [The Weighted Climate Dataset](https://weightedclimatedata.streamlit.app/ 'climate'), together with [Marco Gortan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-gortan/), [Giorgio Fagiolo](https://sites.google.com/view/giorgiofagiolo/home), and [Francesco Lamperti](http://www.francescolamperti.eu/). The papers introducing this tool are available [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03304-1) and [here](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2024/34)

- COVID-19, a joint work with [Tobia Boschi](https://research.ibm.com/people/tobia-boschi), [Jacopo Di Iorio](https://science.psu.edu/stat/people/jqd5830), [Francesca Chiaromonte](https://sites.psu.edu/chiaromonte/), and [Marzia A. Cremona](https://marziacremona.com/). Results of our first paper appeared in the news [[1]](https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/staying-home-primary-care-and-limiting-contagion-hubs-may-curb-covid-19-deaths/), [[2, Italian]](https://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/covid-italia-statistica-che-analizza-prima-ondata-perche-tassi-mortalita-tanto-diversi-le-regioni-AEfHQmf), [[3, Italian]](https://www.santannapisa.it/it/news/covid-19-italia-la-statistica-fa-luce-sul-perche-la-prima-ondata-abbia-causato-tassi-di), and as a [SciPod's audio book](https://www.scipod.global/dr-marzia-cremona-using-functional-data-analysis-to-better-understand-covid-19-mortality/). A second paper is now available as a preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09820)!

- Venture Capital investments, an analysis of the determinants of success of start-ups financing through venture capitals. Results, which were obtained and validated with a combination of network, functional data and multivariate analysis tools, were published [here](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-022-00482-y) (as a journal article) and [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-93409-5_61) (as a conference proceeding). [This](https://youtube.com/shorts/o4ccLoCdReI?feature=share) is a very short and informal presentation of the results (in Italian).

You can find my publication record in my [CV](https://testalorenzo.github.io/cv/) and on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gDmLTJQAAAAJ&hl "Google_Scholar") profile.
