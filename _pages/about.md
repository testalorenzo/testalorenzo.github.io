## About me

Hi! I am a second-year Ph.D. student in *Statistics* at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html). I am incredibly lucky to be advised by [Kathryn Roeder](https://kathrynmroeder.github.io/) and [Jing Lei](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~jinglei/). I am also a Junior Research Affiliate at L'EMbeDS Department, [Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies](https://www.santannapisa.it/en), Pisa, where I have previously been an Honors student advised by [Francesca Chiaromonte](https://sites.psu.edu/chiaromonte/) and [Andrea Mina](https://www.santannapisa.it/en/andrea-mina). I come from [Torre de' Roveri](https://testalorenzo.github.io/images/tdr.jpg), a small and beautiful town on the foothills of the Orobie Mountains, Italy.

## Updates

**5/20/2025:** I have started working as a summer research scientist intern at Amazon in Bellevue, WA! I am very excited about this opportunity!

**5/13/2025:** A new preprint on doubly-robust estimation and inference in semi-supervised settings is out. Check it out [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06452).

**1/14/2025:** We just released a new preprint on doubly-robust estimation of average treatment effects when outcomes are measured over a continuous domain, such as functional data. Check it out [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06024)!

**12/13/2024:** I will present our work on the comparison between the first two waves of the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy at [CMStats 2024](https://www.cmstatistics.org/CFECMStatistics2024/index.php) in London, UK, and then an ongoing project on estimating protein isoform abundances with `PAQu` at [ICSDS 2024](https://sites.google.com/view/ims-icsds2024/) in Nice, France.

**10/22/2024:** The paper introducing `FAStEN`, our efficient algorithm for feature selection and estimation in functional regressions, has been published in JCGS. You can find it [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2024.2407464)!
